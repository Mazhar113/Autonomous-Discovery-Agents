## 🚀  Overview

This repository contains a **fully modular Python simulation** of autonomous discovery agents designed for **space rovers** or **deep-sea drones**.  
Agents are capable of:

- Detecting novel formations or points of interest in unknown environments.
- Planning and prioritizing scientific tasks autonomously.
- Executing experiments and collecting data without waiting for remote commands.
- Learning and adapting based on the outcomes of previous tasks.
- Visualizing exploration in real-time.

The simulation is ideal for testing autonomous decision-making in environments with **high latency or unknown terrains**.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Novelty Detection:** Uses Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.
- **Autonomous Task Planning:** Chooses tasks like sample collection, composition analysis, or environmental measurement.
- **Task Execution & Data Logging:** Simulates experiment execution and logs results.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Updates exploration strategy based on simulated rewards.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Plots agent movement and novel points dynamically.
- **Modular Python Architecture:** Easy to extend for advanced robotics integration.
